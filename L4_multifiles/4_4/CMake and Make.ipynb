    "In the previous notebook, you saw how example code could be split into multiple `.h` and `.cpp` files, and you used `g++` to build all of the files together. For small projects with a handful of files, this works well. But what would happen if there were hundreds, or even thousands, of files in the project? You could type the names of the files at the command line each time, but there tools to make this easier.\n",

    "Many larger C++ projects use a [build system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software) to manage all the files during the build process. The build system allows for large projects to be compiled with a few commands, and build systems are able to do this in an efficient way by only recompiling files that have been changed.\n",
